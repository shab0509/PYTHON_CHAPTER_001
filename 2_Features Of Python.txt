Feature are the facilities or services provided by language developer to the programmer 
for developing real time application.

Below is the list of feature:
----------------------------

1. Simple 

>> Rich set of API'services 
>> Inbuilt facility of "Garbage Collector" 
   It is a prg running in background whose role is collecting unused memory space & improve performance.
>> User-Friendly Syntax


2. Freeware & Open Source
    Freeware : s/w is free.
    Open Source :  Some Company came forward and customized Cpython called "Distribution of Python"
                   JPYTHON/ANACONDA PYTHON/RUBY PYTHON

                   
3. Platform Independent
   A language is said to be platform Independent if & only if it's program run on any OS with considering its vendor.
   C  programming : whose datatypes takes different memory space 
   JAVA programming : whose datatypes takes same memory space & same goes with Python.


4. Dynamic Typed Programming 
   
  In Context programming language, we have 2 types
    >> Static Typed PL :: In this PL, It is mandatory for programmer to specify the data type otherwise we will compile time error.
    >> Dynamically Typed PL :: In this PL, the language runtime environment will decide the data type of the value assigned by the programmer.


5. High Level PL 

  >> Low level PL :  In this we represent the data in the form of binary , hex or octal which is understandable by machine but not by human
  >> High Level PL : low level PL data representation is automatically converted into HLL understandable format. 1.e Decimal Number System


6. Robust 

   >> It is robust(strong) coz of programming fetaure called Exception Handling.
   >> Runtime errors of program are called exception, Exception always give technical error messages which are understandable by programmer but not by application user 
   >> Process of converting technical error message into user friendly error message is called exception handling.

7. Extensible 

   >> Python PL giving its PL facilities to other language & hence extensive

8. Embedded

   >> Python PL can call other language coding segment for faster execution purpose. for ex : Pyhton code can call C programming language.


9. Support third party API's  :: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit, Matplotlib
